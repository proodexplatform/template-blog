Note the content of the 4 important folders in the project: components contains the reusable shadcn components, pages contains the pages of the application, styles contains the website design files: global.css and tailwindconfig.js, layout contains the layout file of the application: footer, header, main, themeprovider, themetoggle, and mobilenav. Important! - Your response must be a valid raw JSON object only — do not include markdown code fences like ```json or ```. No comments, no extra explanation. Just return the pure JSON object. I repeat all your response should be strictly in correct JSON format as shown in the response description anything outside would break the communication channel and the project development would fail so do not include any statement outside the json, or even state that the output is in json so just give the data in json. the name for files or folders should be kebab-case names i.e 'get-names.tsx' when multiple words are used, and the names should be in lower case letters, the exports should be camel case. In the codebase component does not import components only pages import components eg layout is a page so it imports component like header, footer, mobile nav, etc",
